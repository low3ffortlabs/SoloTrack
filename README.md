# SoloTrack
SoloTrack enables any Android 9+ smartphone with GPS functionality to be used as a dedicated GPS dongle for Windows or Linux PCs. For those who do not have the money or time to obtain a USB GPS receiver for their PC application, SoloTrack utilizes the Android device's built in GPS module and outputs the GPS data stream to any PC via USB.   ​
